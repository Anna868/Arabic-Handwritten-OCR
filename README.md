# Arabic-Handwritten-OCR
## Step 1: Line Segmentation of Parargraph images
In step 1, you input an image of a handwritten body of Arabic text (i.e. paragraph with multiple lines) and you receive an output folder containing a number of images equal to the number of lines written in the input paragraph image. Each output image contains a handwritten line.

I have provided an example of a paragraph image taken from [KHATT dataset](http://khatt.ideas2serve.net/index.php) below. Notice that the chosen example has lines which are almost parallel with the horizontal edge of the image frame and the lines have uniform spacings. This is crucial for the algorithm to extract the lines correctly. If your image does not meet these requirements, you may consider preprocessing steps such as [deskewing the image](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/20/text-skew-correction-opencv-python/).

The output of the algorithm (for the first line) should look like this.

Because the paragraphs are handwritten in freestyle, some letters with descenders and/or ascenders may overlap with the lines above and/or below the current line. The algorithm uses the gradients of the intensity histograms of thresholded images to find the best cut position for each individual line that will maximize the line content.

## Step 2: Word and subword segmentation of Line images

## Step 3: Word images preprocessing
## Step 4: Training the model (DCNNs + Bidirectional LSTMs with CTC Loss)
